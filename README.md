# Bash scripts

### `scf.sh`

Synchronizes specific configuration files or directories in the home folder between devices. Useful if you don't want to clutter up the interface of synchronization services with excessive and minimal specifications; as a byproduct, it is useful for storing said configuration archives on a separate storage unit independent from the home folder. 

### `glacier.sh`

Does a backup from a list of directories to a physical drive. Also, checks data integrity to avoid loss of information and generates logs for streamlined error debugging.
